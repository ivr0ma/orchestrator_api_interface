# Orchestrator API Interface

## Overview
The `orchestrator_api_interface` module is a Streamlit-based frontend application designed to interact with two backend services:
1. **[Todo-SQLite API](https://github.com/ivr0ma/todo_app)**: A service for managing tasks.
2. **[Short URL API](https://github.com/ivr0ma/shorturl_app)**: A service for URL shortening.

The interface provides a unified way to perform operations such as task management, URL shortening, and retrieving related statistics.

## Features
- Manage tasks (create, update, delete, view).
- Shorten URLs and retrieve their statistics.
- User-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit.
